				<p>In the light of the announcement from <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/depictions-racism-magic-2020-06-10">Wizards of the Coast</a> to ban cards for being racist or culturally offensive from all sanctioned tournaments, we propose to ban all those cards as well from Archon. We also propose that all cards that are banned in the future for these reasons by Wizards of the Coast from all sanctioned tournaments, should automatically be banned in Archon as well.</p>
				<p>We think that it is not important if you agree with the position of Wizards or not. Not following Wizards example suggests to others that Archon has no problem with cards that Wizards considers racist.</p>
